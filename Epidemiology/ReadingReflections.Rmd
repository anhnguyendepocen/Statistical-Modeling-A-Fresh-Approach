## Reading Reflections for Epidemiology

A "reading reflection" is a short essay --- one or two paragraphs that you should be able to write in about five minutes.  

### Epidemiology as a Liberal Art

* Fraser describes 5 "kinds of thinking."  Were you surprised at what they are?  Are they really about the liberal arts?
`r I(moodle(13654,"fraser"))`

### The Score

* What was the system for evaluating the condition of a new-born that the APGAR score replaced? 
`r I(moodle(13652,"apgar"))`

### The Great Influenza

#### Pages 1-47

* Many medical treatments in the past strike us today as silly.  But they often made sense at the time, emerging logically from a theoretical framework.  Pick an example from the reading and explain briefly how the treatment made sense in terms of the theory.
`r I(moodle(33333,"GI1"))`


### Truth and Death in Iraq Under Sanctions

* Of course, you have no direct way to evaluate the claims made in this article.  What do you look for when assessing the reliability or truthfulness of the claims?
`r I(moodle(33333,"iraq"))`
