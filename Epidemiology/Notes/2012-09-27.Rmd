### Distribution of Diseases in Different Countries

A horrible, side-by-side pie chart graph.  Talk about how to make the graphic more effective.  The key principle is to bring adjacent the things that you want to compare.

### Outbreaks

Different types of outbreaks: 
* point source, limited time (food poisoning)
* point source, environmental toxin (uranium mine tailings) --- might show an increase as more people are exposed for more time
* transmissible: endemic, epidemic, pandemic (enzootic, epizootic)


### Basic Information about Disease

* Examples of diseases and conditions: Acute/Chronic, Infectious/Noninfectious, Communicable/Noncommunciable

* Inanimate sources:

* Portal of entry and exit:

### Spread and Immunization

* Severity

* Sources of resistance

### Herd Immunity

### Epidemic Curves

* Epidemic curve for a point-source epidemic.
![EE Figure 12.4 point-source](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5098197/Epidemiology/Figures/EE-Fig-12-4.png)
* Epidemic curve for a propagative epidemic, in the early phases when the waves are still distinct.

* The Danish tuberculosis epidemic.

* Conversion rate for students in different settings:

* Long-term tracking of cases ![EE Table 12.3](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5098197/Epidemiology/Figures/EE-Table-12-3.png)

### Discussion of P-CAST Report

[The report](http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/documents/PCAST_H1N1_Report.pdf).

* Look at their scenario in Box 3A on page 19.  What are the assumptions that are going into it?  (Ten-fold increase every week, about half the population susceptible.  Sketch out the incidence, and the cumulative incidence curves.)
* Page 2: "In Australia, 11 percent of over 20,000 confirmed cases of 2009-H1N1 influenza have been hospitalized.  And of the 410 cases now hospitalized, 110 are in ICUs."  Why would it be misleading to say that 1/4 of hospitalized cases go to ICU.
* Why was the initial case-fatality rate estimated in Mexico so high?
* Note how they used an estimate to discover a bottle-neck --- anticipating 50-100% of ICU capacity will be needed.  But no estimate of how long people will stay in the ICU.
* What's the problem with a single go/no-go decision, which they identified as the problem in the 1975 swine-flu situtation?
