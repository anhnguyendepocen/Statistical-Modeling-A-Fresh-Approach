<h2>Short Essays and Reading Reflections for Epidemiology</h2>

<p>A &ldquo;reading reflection&rdquo; is a short essay &mdash; one or two paragraphs that you should be able to write in about five minutes.  </p>

<h3>Epidemiology as a Liberal Art: Reading Reflection</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Fraser describes five &ldquo;kinds of thinking.&rdquo;  Were you surprised at what they are?  Are they really about the liberal arts?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the most important thing you learned from this reading?</p></li>
<li><p>If there was anything you found confusing, please describe it.</p>

<h3>The Score: Reading Reflection</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>What was the system for evaluating the condition of a new-born that the APGAR score replaced? </p></li>
<li><p>What is the most important thing you learned from this reading?</p></li>
<li><p>If there was anything you found confusing, please describe it.</p>

<h3>Your Own APGAR score: <a name="apgarscore">Short Essay</a></h3>

<p>One of the themes in Atul Gawande’s essay, “<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/10/09/061009fa_fact?currentPage=1">The Score</a>,” in <em>Better: A Surgeon’s Notes on Performance</em>, is the emergence of the APGAR score as a way to measure birth outcomes. Following the suggestion of former CDC head David Fraser in his <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5098197/Epidemiology/Fraser-NEJM-epidemiology.pdf">New England Journal of Medicine</a> article that “analogic thinking” is an important aspect of epidemiology that can contribute to a liberal education, your assigned task is to invent an APGAR score of your own in an area of your own choosing. Some suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li>An APGAR score for academic advising at college. (DTK has proposed this at Macalester.) </li>
<li>An APGAR score for sports performance. </li>
<li>An APGAR score for whether you have done your work for the next school day. </li>
<li>An APGAR score for feedback to professors about class sessions. (Quantify the one-minute essays!)</li>
</ul>

<p>Be creative! But also be specific about what components would go into the overall score, paying particular attention to the importance of being able to score the components at a glance.</p>

<p>Your answer should consist of a brief description of the problem, followed by a list of the components in your score. Each of these components should have a one- or two-sentence explanation that would make sense to someone familiar with the area of application. For example, in my academic advising score, one of the components is whether the student has decided on a major. <a href="https://moodle.macalester.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=15122">Hand in on Moodle</a></p>

<h3>Your Own <a name="glossary">Glossary of Epidemiology</a></h3>

<p>As you read in Epi, you will come across many terms that are either new to you or would be new to someone you are telling about epidemiology.  Keep track of these in a Google Doc as the semester goes by.</p>

<p><strong>Create the Google Doc now</strong>. Share it with <code>kaplan@macalester.edu</code>.  Then go to <a href="https://moodle.macalester.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=15123">Moodle</a> and enter the link to that document.  You might also want to bookmark it in your browser, so you can easily get back to it.</p>

<p>Over the semester, add to the glossary.  When you don&#39;t know the meaning of a term, and the definition doesn&#39;t make sense to you, just write down the term and come back to it later.  You&#39;ll learn more if you write the definition in your own words.</p>

<h3>Welcome to the Island</h3>

<p>One of the goals of this course is to give you insight into how epidemiological data is collected and how epidemiological studies are performed. A great way to do this is for you to perform actual studies on actual populations. But this is impractical in the scope of a one-semester introductory course, to say nothing about the practical difficulties of setting up studies and the ethical difficulties relating to privacy and contact with patients by non-professionals.</p>

<p>Computers to the rescue. Prof. Michael Bulmer, a statistician at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, has been developing a realistic population simulator: <a href="http://island.maths.uq.edu.au/">The Island</a>. (Prof. Bulmer spent his sabbatical in Spring/Summer 2010 at Macalester, which was the first site outside Australia to use the simulation.) We&#39;ll use this as the substrate for your studies. Of course this means that your results won&#39;t be applicable to actual human populations, but on the other hand you&#39;ll be able to get much more data in a much shorter time, and even to impose interventions on the people of The Island that would be impractical and unethical on real humans.</p>

<p>Each student has his or her own account, effectively working on his or her own copy of the population on The Island. (When working on a group, you may want to all use the same account.) </p>

<p>Accounts were created for most students based on the enrollment information available at the beginning of the semester. To get your password, follow <a href="http://island.maths.uq.edu.au/password.php">this link</a> and enter your Macalester email address. Your island password will be mailed to you. If your email is not recognized as a valid account ID, contact Prof. Kaplan who will arrange to have an account set up for you.</p>

<p>Once you have set up your account and received your password, you <a href="http://island.maths.uq.edu.au/access.php?/index.php">login here</a>.</p>

<h3>The Great Influenza</h3>

<h4>Pages 1-47: Reading Reflection</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Many medical treatments in the past strike us today as silly.  But they often made sense at the time, emerging logically from a theoretical framework.  Pick an example from the reading and explain briefly how the treatment made sense in terms of the theory.</p></li>
