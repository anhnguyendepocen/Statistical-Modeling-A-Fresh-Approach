Errata and Changes in *Statistical Modeling: A Fresh Approach* 2e
========================================================

## `mosaic`-Related Changes

The software used in *Statistical Modeling* is distributed via the `mosaic` package in R.  The current version of `mosaic` differs in some details from the version available in summer 2011 when the 2nd edition of *Statistical Modeling* was released.  

The changes affect only a few pages. Rather than release an entire new edition of the book to match the changed software, we have made a "corrected" printing.  For those readers who have the original summer 2011 printing (particularly students who have used books), we provide a list of the changed pages and PDF copies of the pages themselves.

Changed Pages:

* p. 42: Use of `$` operator (deprecated in current `mosaic` version)
* p. 43: Use of `transform` to add new variables to a data frame
* p. 83: Use of `transform`.  Introduction of `mm` operator for groupwise mean models.
