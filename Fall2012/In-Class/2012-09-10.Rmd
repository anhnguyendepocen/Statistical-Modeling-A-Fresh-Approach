* What's the `c()` operator about?

It collects things together.
Try:
```{r}
sqrt(3,5,7)
```
The `sqrt()` operator is designed to work with a single input.  So it doesn't do the obvious thing here.  `c()` will put the things together into a single object:
```{r}
sqrt( c(3,5,7))
```
We'll use `c()` when we want to assemble a very small dataset quickly, although usually we'll read this from a data file.
