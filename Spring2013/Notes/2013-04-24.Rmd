### Preliminaries:

One group is doing an experiment to see how quickly people respond to emails/moodle/twitter.  Some of the notices will be sent out through this course, so you will all see them.  You don't have to respond if you don't want to.  But I want to encourage you to join the study.

### Short review of odds

* Two way table in the standard format
    * The odds ratio: A*C/B*D
* Logistic regression and the link function
    * Odds $=\frac{p}{1-p}$
    * Probability $\frac{odds}{1+odds}$
* Model formula from logistic regression gives the log odds.
