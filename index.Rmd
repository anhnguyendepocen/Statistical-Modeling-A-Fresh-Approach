Instructors' Resources for Teaching Statistical Modeling
========================================================

### Day-by-Day Syllabus for Statistical Modeling

* Fall 2012: [Math 155 at Macalester College](Fall2012/Schedule.html) including instructor notes.



### Activities

#### Introductory

* [Magic Coins](Notes/magic-coins.html) --- an activity to help students see that they must be able to characterize randomness in order to draw reasonable conclusions.
* [Coin Flipping](Notes/coin-flipping.html) --- a magic trick to show that there are patterns in randomness.  It's possible to tell (often) whether a sequence of coin flips was generated by a formal random process or a human trying to be random.
