Instructors' Resources for Teaching Statistical Modeling
========================================================

### Day-by-Day Syllabus for Statistical Modeling

* Fall 2012: [Math 155 at Macalester College](Fall2012/Schedule.html) including instructor notes.
* [Spring 2011](http://test.causeweb.org/wiki/mosaic/index.php/Math_155_Kaplan_Spring_2011_Day-by-Day) on the MOSAIC wiki.


### Activities

#### Introductory

##### Patterns in Randomness

Math 155 spends most of the first half of the course setting students up to construct models.  Statistical inference, with its connections to randomness, is added in the second half.  On the very first day, however, I do an activity or two involving randomness to foreshadow statistical inference.  (There is also a discussion of confidence intervals in Chapter 5 of the 2nd edition, in the middle of the first half of the course.)

* [Magic Coins](Notes/magic-coins.html) --- an activity to help students see that they must be able to characterize randomness in order to draw reasonable conclusions.
* [Statistical Fingerprints](Notes/coin-flipping.html) --- statistics provides techniques to detect relationships.  As a demonstration of this, consider detecting whether there is a human making up coin flips or a genuine, physical coin-flipping process. 

##### Computing

Even on the first day, I have students log in to the [RStudio](http:/www.rstudio.com) server and do a few guided calculations.  On the second day I introduce them more systematically to the syntax and data organization.
