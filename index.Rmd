### Blogs

Published
* [Instructor update on the mosaic package](Blog/Teaching-with-mosaic.html)
* [List of `mosaic` related changes in the corrected (Summer 2012) printing](Errata/errata.html).  This is useful for students who have the first printing of the second edition, e.g. students with used books in Fall 2012.  There are just a handful of changes, but it's important to be aware of them.

### Activities

#### Introductory

##### Patterns in Randomness

Math 155 spends most of the first half of the course setting students up to construct models.  Statistical inference, with its connections to randomness, is added in the second half.  On the very first day, however, I do an activity or two involving randomness to foreshadow statistical inference.  (There is also a discussion of confidence intervals in Chapter 5 of the 2nd edition, in the middle of the first half of the course.)

* [Magic Coins](Notes/magic-coins.html) --- an activity to help students see that they must be able to characterize randomness in order to draw reasonable conclusions.
* [Statistical Fingerprints](Notes/coin-flipping.html) --- statistics provides techniques to detect relationships.  As a demonstration of this, consider detecting whether there is a human making up coin flips or a genuine, physical coin-flipping process. 

##### Computing

Even on the first day, I have students log in to the [RStudio](http:/www.rstudio.com) server and do a few guided calculations.  On the second day I introduce them more systematically to the syntax and data organization.

* [Data Organization](Activities/IntroOrganizingData.html)

##### Data Organization

* The Elevator Experiment
* [How Many Variables?](Activities/HowManyVariables.html) Distinguishing between summary tables and basic case-variable data tables.
