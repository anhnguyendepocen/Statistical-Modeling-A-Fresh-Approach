Main Ideas for Today
====================

1. From Model Terms to Vectors
    1. The intercept term as a vector of 1s
    1. Understanding interaction terms as vectors
1. The geometry of fitting against two vectors.
1. Colinearity and why adding model terms changes the coefficients on old terms.  (Reference: housing prices versus bedrooms with and without  living area)
    1. Simpson's paradox, geometrically.
    1. Extreme colinearity: redundancy

Heads up for the future: colinearity has an important effect on confidence intervals.
