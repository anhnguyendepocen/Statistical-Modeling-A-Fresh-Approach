### Review of Partial Derivatives

Change of one variable holding the other ones constant

* Calculation from a model formula using coefficients
* Calculation from model function by evaluating at nearby points

### Real-world examples

* Insurance example: Should we pay people not to be on the College's health plan?
* NGOs and development aid: Speaker Christie Hansen talked about how donors for health funding in Kenya ended up funding other activities as the government moved money away from health toward agriculture, etc.
* Merit aid. Will it reduce net tuition or increase it. Depends on whether we substantially change the yield.
